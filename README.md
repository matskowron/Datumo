This code reads a file input.txt as an input and check if there are any pairs summing to 12. 
The script does not require any additional libraries to install.


## Run the file
To run the file type in the folder the terminal:

```python
 python3 pairs.py
```

When run a message will pop up, to inform the user that the file input.txt is read. Press ENTER to continue. This was implemented to give the user feedback, and if needed, allow to access the file before running the script.

## Run the tests

This project uses Unittest library.

```python
 python3 test_pairs.py
```
